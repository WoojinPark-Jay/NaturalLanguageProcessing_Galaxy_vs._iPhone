Analysis Summary 

Evaluate the performance of each of the smartphone models, i.e., Samsung Galaxy S8, iPhone8 and iPhone X by analysing how people feel about each of the models before and after the release dates. We do this by gathering data from online sources across various social networking platforms in the form of posts/comments/reviews. We majorly make use of Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modelling (NMF), Time Series Prediction Modelling as the different techniques to understand what people feel about each of the products thereby leading us to a good model that validates the findings.

Find the most important features that people focus on while they comment or post their opinions about the product and see if there is a positive, negative or neutral sentiment attached to it. By doing this, we can find out how the companies can improve their businesses by focusing on features that people feel the product has missed out on in their upcoming versions/releases.

Also look at the most important attributes such as “Price”, “Quality” and “Value” to see how people feel the products has performed individually. We draw a comparison between the smartphone models to observe which product is valued the highest, is priced appropriately and has the best quality. By plotting the trends of sentiments in terms of positivity, negativity and neutrality using polarity for individual products before and after the release, we predict the uptake/adoption of the product.
